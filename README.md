This is the code for powerhourtimer.com a pet project of mine used to play power hours or centuries (lots of drinking for those who don't know).

I decided to put it on github because firstly, if anyone that uses the site would like to implement something that'd be cool.  Plus I'm trying to get to know git.

For questions or anything please email powerhourtimer@gmail.com
